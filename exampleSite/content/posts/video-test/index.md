## Multiple Videos on One Page

First video:

Second video:

{{< video youtube="jNQXAC9IVRw" title="Second Video" >}}

## Video with Surrounding Content

This paragraph appears before the video embed. The video player should integrate smoothly with surrounding text content without layout shifts.

{{< video bilibili="BV1GJ411x7h7" title="Inline Video" >}}

This paragraph appears after the video embed. Proper spacing between content and the video container is essential for good readability.
